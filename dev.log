`optimizeDeps.rollupOptions` / `ssr.optimizeDeps.rollupOptions` is deprecated. Use `optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions` instead. Note that this option may be set by a plugin. Set VITE_DEPRECATION_TRACE=1 to see where it is called.
[vite:react-babel] We recommend switching to `@vitejs/plugin-react-oxc` for improved performance. More information at https://vite.dev/rolldown
